â€‹<strong>OK so follow Up :</strong> What if there are repeated values. 

So that time node->val == target->val will not work

remember : Target is belonging to original and not target<br>
My  Approach : Run a Traversal method and then compare the original and target directly
              
              
              if(original == target)
               {
                    ans = cloned;
                    return;
               }
