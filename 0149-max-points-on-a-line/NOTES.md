#### Logic :
​
Catch one points as a base point
Calculalate all angles of all vectors from that point to every other points except itself!
​
store them in a map
map<angle , count>
​
so After dng that for a particular base point
go through the Map and store the max points that have the same angle
​
Vectors having same angles ==> lie on the same line
